Each length of board is routed with one or more lines of text.  The floor includes 556 lines of text, in reverse, in eleven languages and alphabets, and consists of the first sentences of books found in the ESL/World Languages collection.  The type is set in reverse for two reasons: to reference how books are produced from typeface and to reference how we learn to read, from symbols that are first unknown to us.'</td><td>Installation</td><td>Tongue-and-groove maple floor                                                                                              </td><td>7,200 sq ft                                                                                                                                 </td><td>2004  </td><td>Central Library                                                                                                          </td><td>1000 4th Ave                                  </td><td>47.60650</td><td>-122.3331</td><td>1000 4th Ave\nSeattle, WA\n(47.6065, -122.333117)                                    </td></tr>\n\t<tr><td>LIB05.006</td><td>LIBRARIES FOR ALL - GREENWOOD BRANCH                       </td><td>Fernanda </td><td>D' Agostino, Fernanda</td><td>Into the Green Wood                        </td><td>'Multi-layered tempered laminated glass with silk-screened glass enamels in insulated glass units and installed as an architectural component in the front facade window and panels in the reading room and study room windows.
